A vast majority of the people are invariably affected but the production of crops. Farmers, for example, rely on them for their survival. The consumers, on the other
hand, depend on the crops as it provides them with a multitude of utilities. It therefore, becomes essential to protect and maintain these crops.Crop failure also 
deteriorates the quality of the yield thereby decreasing the quality of living.The project aims at improving the farmers’ situation by preventing them from incurring
losses due to the damage of crops.

Iot Based Smart Crop Protection System for Agriculture
Problem statement:
        	A vast majority of the people are invariably affected by the production of crops. Farmers, for example, rely on them for their survival. The consumers, on the other hand, depend on the crops as it provides them with a multitude of utilities. It therefore, becomes essential to protect and maintain these crops. The project aims at improving the farmers’ situation by preventing them from incurring losses due to the damage of crops. Crop failure also deteriorates the quality of the yield thereby decreasing the quality of living.
Who does the problem affect?
Persons who do Agriculture
What are the boundaries of the problem?
Persons who grow crops and the hurdles caused by animals and environmental factors.
What is the issue?
In agricultural aspects, the crop gets affected by animals and environmental parameters. This reduces growth, productivity.
When does the issue occur?
During the growth phase of the crop.
Where does the issue occur?
This issue occurs in agricultural fields, farm lands and agriculture fields.
Why is it important that we fix the problem?
It is required for the growth and better quality of the crop. This helps both farmers and consumers equally and it is important to maximise the crop yield.
What solution to solve this issue?
PIR sensor is used to protect the crops from wild animals.
Temperature sensor, humidity sensor and moisture sensor are used to protect the crops from environmental factors.
