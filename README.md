A vast majority of the people are invariably affected but the production of crops. Farmers, for example, rely on them for their survival. The consumers, on the other
hand, depend on the crops as it provides them with a multitude of utilities. It therefore, becomes essential to protect and maintain these crops. The project aims at
improving the farmersâ€™ situation by preventing them from incurring losses due to the damage of crops. Crop failure also deteriorates the quality of the yield thereby
decreasing the quality of living.
